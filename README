PLEASE RATE THIS PLUGIN, IF YOU LIKE IT! 

Feedback is always welcome. See :h DistractFree-feedback. 

This plugin has been made to enable a WriteRoom/DarkRoom/OmniWriter like behaviour in Vim.

When enabled, all unnecessary features are turned off, so you can concentrate
on writing with Vim. It also creates on each side a couple of empty windows,
so that the text will be centered around the screen.

This plugin defines the following commands:

:DistractFreeToggle

This commnd toggles between normal Vim mode and the distraction free mode.

Alternatively, you can use the key <leader>W in normal mode to toggle between normal
mode and Distraction Free mode. (If you haven't setup your leaderkey, see| use the '&#039 key)
